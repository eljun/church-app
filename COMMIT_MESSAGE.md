# Commit Message for Phase 4: Transfer Management

```
feat: complete Phase 4 - Transfer Management System

Implemented a complete transfer management system for handling member
transfers between churches with role-based permissions, approval workflow,
and comprehensive UI.

## Features Added

### Core Transfer System
- Transfer request form with member/church selection
- Bulk transfer tool for transferring multiple members at once
- Pending transfers table with approve/reject actions
- Transfer history view with complete audit trail
- Transfer detail page with full request information
- Statistics cards showing pending, approved, and total transfers

### UI Components
- TransferStats: Statistics cards for transfer metrics
- PendingTransfersTable: Actionable table for pending requests
- TransferHistoryTable: Read-only historical transfers view
- TransferRequestForm: Form for single member transfers
- BulkTransferForm: Multi-step wizard for bulk operations
- TransferActions: Approve/reject action buttons
- MemberSelect: Searchable member combobox
- ChurchSelect: Searchable church combobox

### Pages Created
- /transfers - Main page with Pending/History tabs
- /transfers/new - Create single transfer request
- /transfers/[id] - View transfer request details
- /transfers/bulk - Bulk transfer tool

## Bug Fixes

### RLS Policy Fix
- Added missing superadmin INSERT policy for transfer_requests table
- Created migration: 003_fix_transfer_request_rls.sql
- Allows superadmins to create transfers from any church

### Approve Transfer Validation Fix
- Removed approved_by from approveTransferSchema
- Server action now sets approved_by automatically from auth.uid()
- Fixed validation error: "Invalid user ID"

### UI Consistency Fixes
- Separated combined "Transfer" column into "From Church" and "To Church"
- Made both source and destination church links clickable
- Applied consistent styling across pending and history tables
- Improved visual hierarchy with color coding

## Technical Details

### Database
- Row Level Security policies for transfer_requests
- Superadmin and admin role-based permissions
- Audit logging for all transfer actions

### Validation
- Zod schemas for type-safe operations
- Cannot transfer to same church
- Cannot create duplicate pending transfers
- Member must belong to source church

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Validation at both client and server levels

## Dependencies

## Documentation
