- ⚠️ **Requires Manual Action:** 2 issues (environment secrets rotation)
- 📋 **Recommended:** 4 improvements for future phases

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities (P0)

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Environment Variables Best Practices
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** REMEDIATED
**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-21

**Issue:**
- `.env.local` file pattern could expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if committed
- Service role key can bypass all Row Level Security (RLS) policies

**Risk:**
- Complete database compromise if secrets leaked
- Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion
- Potential data breach affecting all church member data

**Remediation Applied:**
- ✅ Verified `.env*` pattern already in `.gitignore` (line 40)
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template with documentation
- ✅ Confirmed `.env.local` never committed to git history
- ✅ Added security warnings in `.env.example`

**Manual Action Required:**
```bash
# If using production/staging environments:
# 1. Rotate Supabase Service Role Key in Supabase dashboard
# 2. Update environment variables in deployment platform
# 3. Never commit actual .env.local to version control
```

## High Priority Issues (P1)

### 2. ✅ FIXED: API Route Missing RBAC Validation
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** REMEDIATED
**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-21

**Issue:**
- `/api/calendar` route lacked comprehensive permission checks
- `/api/reports/custom` route had no authentication or authorization

**Risk:**
- Unauthorized users could access calendar data
- Custom reports could be generated without permission checks
- Potential information disclosure

**Remediation Applied:**
```typescript
// apps/web/app/api/calendar/route.ts
✅ Added canAccessModule(userData.role, 'calendar') check
✅ Consistent 401/403 error responses
✅ User authentication verification

// apps/web/app/api/reports/custom/route.ts
✅ Added authentication check
✅ Added canAccessModule(userData.role, 'reports') check
✅ Proper error handling with status codes
```

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/api/calendar/route.ts`
- `apps/web/app/api/reports/custom/route.ts`

---

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Performance-Based DoS Vulnerability
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** REMEDIATED
**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-21

**Issue:**
- `getScopeChurches()` function queried database on every RBAC check
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed permission data
- Could be exploited for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

**Risk:**
- Database query spam from permission checks
- Application slowdown under load
- Potential service disruption

**Remediation Applied:**
```typescript
// apps/web/lib/rbac/helpers.ts
✅ Wrapped getScopeChurches() with React cache()
✅ Per-request caching eliminates duplicate queries
✅ Significant performance improvement for pastor/field_secretary roles
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before:** Multiple DB queries per page load
- **After:** Single cached query per request

---

### 4. ✅ FIXED: Duplicate Authentication Queries
**Severity:** MEDIUM → HIGH (Performance Impact)
**Status:** REMEDIATED
**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-21

**Issue:**
- Layout and pages independently queried user authentication data
- Same query executed multiple times per page load
- Wasted database resources and increased latency

**Remediation Applied:**
```typescript
// apps/web/lib/utils/auth-helpers.ts
✅ Created getAuthUser() with React cache
✅ Created getAuthUserRole() for lighter queries
✅ Updated layout.tsx to use cached helper
✅ Updated dashboard page.tsx to use cached helper
```

**Files Created:**
- `apps/web/lib/utils/auth-helpers.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/(protected)/layout.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/(protected)/page.tsx`

---

## Medium Priority Issues (P2)

### 5. ⚠️ PENDING: RLS Policies Outdated
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
**Recommended:** Phase 12.9 or Phase 13

**Issue:**
- RLS policies reference deprecated 'admin' role
- New roles (field_secretary, pastor, coordinator, bibleworker) may not have complete RLS coverage
- Potential permission gaps in database layer

**Risk:**
- Data access inconsistencies
- Permissions enforced in application but not in database
- Bypass via direct database access

**Recommended Action:**
```sql
-- Review and update RLS policies in:
-- packages/database/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql
-- packages/database/migrations/016_add_bibleworker_rls_policies.sql

-- Add policies for:
-- - field_secretary (field-level access)
-- - pastor (district-level access)
-- - coordinator (events-only access)
-- - Updated bibleworker permissions
```

**Files to Audit:**
- `packages/database/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
- `packages/database/migrations/016_add_bibleworker_rls_policies.sql`
- All migration files with RLS policy updates

---

### 6. ⚠️ PENDING: Session Timeout Configuration
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** NEEDS CONFIGURATION
**Recommended:** Phase 13

**Issue:**
- No explicit session timeout configuration visible
- Relying on Supabase default session duration
- No automatic session expiration policy

**Risk:**
- Prolonged session exposure on shared computers
- Increased window for session hijacking
- Compliance issues with security standards

**Recommended Action:**
```typescript
// Configure in Supabase Auth settings:
// - Session timeout: 8 hours (workday)
// - Refresh token rotation: enabled
// - Absolute session limit: 7 days

// Add middleware check:
// - Verify session age
// - Force re-authentication after timeout
// - Clear stale sessions
```

---

### 7. ⚠️ PENDING: Input Validation & Sanitization
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Recommended:** Phase 13

**Issue:**
- Zod schemas validate structure but may not sanitize all inputs
- FormData passed through server actions without explicit sanitization
- Potential XSS vulnerabilities in user-generated content

**Current Protection:**
- ✅ Zod schemas for type validation
- ✅ Parameterized queries (SQL injection protected)
- ✅ React auto-escaping in JSX

**Recommended Improvements:**
- Add HTML sanitization for rich text fields
- Implement CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- Add rate limiting on form submissions
- Validate file uploads more strictly

---

### 8. ⚠️ PENDING: Audit Logging Gaps
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Recommended:** Phase 13

**Issue:**
- Audit logging exists for some operations but incomplete coverage
- No visible audit log retention or deletion policies
- No alerting on suspicious activities

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ User creation/updates
- ✅ Member transfers
- ✅ Member modifications
- ❌ Login attempts (failed/successful)
- ❌ Permission changes
- ❌ Data exports
- ❌ Bulk operations

**Recommended Action:**
- Add comprehensive audit logging for all sensitive operations
- Implement log retention policy (e.g., 1 year)
- Add monitoring/alerting for anomalies
- Log API access patterns

---

## Low Priority / Recommendations (P3)

### 9. Rate Limiting
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Recommended:** Phase 13

Add rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- Authentication endpoints (login/signup)
- API routes (calendar, reports)
- Form submissions
- File uploads

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Use middleware or edge functions
- Implement token bucket algorithm
- Track by IP address and user ID
- Return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

---

### 10. CORS Configuration
**Status:** DEFAULT NEXT.JS SETTINGS
**Recommended:** Phase 13 (if adding external clients)

**Current State:**
- Next.js handles CORS automatically for same-origin
- No explicit CORS configuration

**Action Required:**
- Only if building external API clients
- Configure allowed origins explicitly
- Use environment variables for origin whitelist

---

### 11. Bibleworker Assigned Churches Validation
**Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
**Recommended:** Phase 12.9

**Issue:**
- `assigned_church_ids` stored as array in database
- RLS policies should validate array membership properly
- Ensure users can't modify their own assignments

**Recommended Action:**
- Audit RLS policies for bibleworker role
- Verify array containment checks work correctly
- Test with multiple assigned churches

---

### 12. Security Headers
**Status:** BASIC NEXT.JS DEFAULTS
**Recommended:** Phase 13

Add security headers in `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
headers: async () => [
  {
    source: '/:path*',
    headers: [
      { key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control', value: 'on' },
      { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
      { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
      { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
      { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()' },
    ],
  },
]
```
