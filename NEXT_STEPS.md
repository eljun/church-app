## üéØ Next Phase: Transfer Management

### Goal
Build a complete transfer management system to handle member transfers between churches, including request creation, approval workflow, and history tracking.

### Features Overview

**Transfer System Components:**
1. Transfer Request Form
2. Pending Transfers List (with approval actions)
3. Transfer History View
4. Bulk Transfer Tool
5. Transfer Notifications

### Tasks Breakdown

#### 1. Transfer Request Form (`/transfers/new`)

**Features to implement:**
- [ ] Member selection (searchable dropdown)
- [ ] From Church (auto-filled from member's current church)
- [ ] To Church (dropdown of all churches)
- [ ] Transfer date picker
- [ ] Transfer type (transfer_in / transfer_out)
- [ ] Notes/reason field

- [ ] Auto-create transfer request

**Form fields:**
```typescript
{
  member_id: string (required)
  from_church_id: string (required - auto)
  to_church_id: string (required)
  transfer_date: date (required - default today)
  type: 'transfer_in' | 'transfer_out'
  notes: string (optional)
}
```

**Validation:**
```typescript
// Already exists!
import { createTransferRequestSchema } from '@/lib/validations/transfer'
```

**Actions:**
```typescript
// Already exists!
import { createTransferRequest } from '@/lib/actions/transfers'
```

// 2. Add to transfer_history
// 3. Update member.church_id
// 4. Send notification
```

#### 3. Transfer History (`/transfers/history`)

### üì¶ Additional UI Components Needed

```bash
# Run these commands in apps/web/
npx shadcn@latest add command  # For combobox search
npx shadcn@latest add dialog   # For modals
npx shadcn@latest add textarea # For notes
npx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog  # For confirmations
```

### üîÑ Existing Resources

**Database Schema:**
```typescript
// transfer_requests table
{
  id: uuid
  member_id: uuid
  from_church_id: uuid
  to_church_id: uuid
  request_date: timestamp
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
  approved_by: uuid (nullable)
  approval_date: timestamp (nullable)
  rejection_reason: text (nullable)
  notes: text (nullable)
}

// transfer_history table
{
  id: uuid
  member_id: uuid
  from_church: text
  to_church: text
  from_church_id: uuid
  to_church_id: uuid
  transfer_date: date
  notes: text
}
```

**Queries (to be created):**
- `getTransferRequests()` - List with filters
- `getTransferRequestById()` - Single request detail
- `getPendingTransfers()` - Only pending requests
- `getTransferHistory()` - Historical transfers
- `getMemberTransferHistory()` - Already exists!

**Actions (to be created):**
- `createTransferRequest()` - Create new request
- `approveTransfer()` - Approve and execute transfer
- `rejectTransfer()` - Reject with reason
- `bulkCreateTransfers()` - Create multiple requests

**Validation (to be created):**
- `createTransferRequestSchema` - Zod schema
- `approveTransferSchema` - Zod schema
- `bulkTransferSchema` - Zod schema

### üìù Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Create transfer queries and actions**
```bash
# Create new files
touch apps/web/lib/queries/transfers.ts
touch apps/web/lib/actions/transfers.ts
touch apps/web/lib/validations/transfer.ts

# Implement CRUD operations
# Add proper error handling
# Implement RLS policies
```

**Step 2: Create transfer request form**
```bash
mkdir -p app/(protected)/transfers/new
touch app/(protected)/transfers/new/page.tsx

# Build form with member/church selection
# Add validation
# Connect to createTransferRequest action
```

**Step 3: Create pending transfers list**
```bash
mkdir -p app/(protected)/transfers/pending
touch app/(protected)/transfers/pending/page.tsx

# Build table with filters
# Add approve/reject buttons
# Implement approval workflow
```

**Step 4: Create transfer history view**
```bash
mkdir -p app/(protected)/transfers/history
touch app/(protected)/transfers/history/page.tsx

# Display historical transfers
# Add export functionality
# Show statistics
```

**Step 5: Create bulk transfer tool**
```bash
mkdir -p app/(protected)/transfers/bulk
touch app/(protected)/transfers/bulk/page.tsx

# Multi-select members
# Choose destination
# Bulk create requests
```

### üé® UI/UX Guidelines

**Transfer Request Form:**
- Step-by-step wizard (optional)
- Show member photo and current church
- Visual comparison of from/to churches
- Confirmation dialog before submit
- Success message with request ID

**Pending Transfers Table:**
- Color-coded status badges
- Quick actions (approve/reject icons)
- Expandable rows for details
- Batch selection checkboxes
- Filter by urgent/old requests

**Approval Modal:**
```tsx
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogTitle>Approve Transfer?</AlertDialogTitle>
    <AlertDialogDescription>
      Transfer {memberName} from {fromChurch} to {toChurch}?
      This action will update the member's church assignment.
    </AlertDialogDescription>
    <AlertDialogActions>
      <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
      <Button onClick={handleApprove}>Approve Transfer</Button>
    </AlertDialogActions>
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

**Timeline View:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-4">
  {history.map(transfer => (
    <div className="flex gap-4">
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
        <div className="w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-primary" />
        <div className="w-0.5 h-full bg-border" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="font-medium">{transfer.from_church} ‚Üí {transfer.to_church}</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{formatDate(transfer.date)}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Business Rules

1. **Approval Permissions:**
   - Destination church admin can approve transfers TO their church
   - Source church admin can approve transfers FROM their church
   - Superadmin can approve any transfer
   - Member's status must be 'active' to transfer

2. **Transfer Execution:**
   - On approval:
     1. Update member's church_id
     2. Add entry to transfer_history
     3. Update transfer_request status
     4. Send notification to member (future)
     5. Log action in audit_logs

3. **Validation Rules:**
   - Cannot transfer to same church
   - Member must exist and be active
   - Both churches must be active
   - Cannot have pending transfer for same member

4. **Status Flow:**
   ```
   Created ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected
   (cannot change after approval/rejection)
   ```
